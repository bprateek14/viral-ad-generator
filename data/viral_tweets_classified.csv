"AI will make everything feel very advanced (by today's standards), even as soon as mid-late 2027. Today’s examples - technologies like Veo 3 or Genie 3 - already feel like something from the far future. 

Of course, after a brief shock we quickly adapt to what we see, no matter how crazy the technology is. Still, many innovations evoke reactions like ‘This is insane’ or ‘this is dark magic.’ 

I’ve seen tons of comments like that all over the web, under for example Genie 3 videos.

People from 2019 would think it’s probably 2030s or 2040s tech.

My point is that by 2027, thanks to the influence and growth of AI (not today's gen of AI, but late 2025, 2026 and early 2027 AI, which will make today's AI feel like stone age tech) technology and science will feel like 2030s are already here. 

And as I said before, the real 2030s may feel like Star Trek level tech - more like the 2100s/2200s or in many cases beyond.

Small reminder: today’s most advanced agents can work autonomously for about 2 hours. By 2030s, a single agent could do the equivalent of billions of hours of human work in just a few hours, and by then, we should have billions (if not trillions) of them.",0,0,0,,en,NO
