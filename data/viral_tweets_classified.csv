And turn it into cinema-quality UGC videos with solid brand alignment.

Perfect for e-comm operators, creative strategists & agencies.

Just upload your canvas images + get brand-ready videos with top-notch realism.

Here's what canvas prompting gives you:

→ visual context instead of text descriptions
→ near-perfect product-model integration
→ consistent brand-ready video outputs
→ way higher realism scores

A hyper-realistic, cinematic video captures a magical jungle ecosystem emerging from a laptop screen into a quiet, sunlit room. The video begins with a close-up shot on a laptop displaying a beautiful jungle image. A single, three-dimensional leaf begins to push through the screen's surface, the pixels distorting and shimmering around it. The ambient sound of the room is joined by a faint, magical, shimmering sound.

The camera slowly pulls back to reveal a full, blossoming tree growing rapidly out of the screen, its branches reaching into the room. Five tiny, energetic monkeys climb out, chattering and exploring their new surroundings. The light from the laptop screen now acts as a magical backlight, casting a vibrant green glow into the room. The quiet is replaced by the lively sounds of the jungle—the chattering of monkeys, the rustle of leaves, and an enchanting birdsong—as the digital and natural worlds seamlessly blend.",0,0,0,,en,YES
"🔥We created 7 ad hooks in 20 minutes using Google’s Veo 3

Here’s the exact step-by-step process we’re using right now to generate high-performing hook variations using ChatGPT + JSON Prompts + Veo 3:

1️⃣ Start with a top-performing ad

Either:
→ a best-performing creative you want to keep scaling
→ or one that’s showing promise but has low thumbstop (under 30%)

2️⃣ Find the core angle and script.
Pull the core idea, script, and visual structure from the winning creative. This becomes your seed for prompting. In this case, it was a first-person shooter-style creative with a spoon of creatine.

💡 We took this visual insight, and 10X’d it in craziness

3️⃣ Use ChatGPT to brainstorm new hooks.
Prompt GPT like this: “You’re a creative strategist at a leading D2C agency. Based on this concept, product, angle, and persona, give me 3–5 Veo 3-style hooks for Meta ads.”

You’ll want to input:
→ Brand
→ Product + benefit
→ Core angle
→ Character/persona
→ A script or framework link

The ideas that come back should be bold, movement-heavy visuals. Think strong setups, pattern-interrupts, cinematic energy.

4️⃣ Pick your favourite idea and convert it into JSON

Once ChatGPT gives you options, choose one and prompt it again: “Turn this into a Veo 3 JSON script format, but don’t generate until I approve.”

JSON works better than freeform text in Veo 3. That JSON format includes everything:

→ Camera type
→ Shot movement
→ Character detail
→ Lighting and style
→ Dialogue tone
→ Constraints (no logos, no text, no music)

5️⃣ Paste into Veo 3 and generate
- Use Text to Video under Google Gemini > Flow
- Always choose V3 Fast, 10p per shot, faster, more output
- Quality mode is slower and haven’t seen any major benefits when A/B testing

6️⃣ Repeat
Use learnings from your account to test both absurd hooks (spoon on a rollercoaster) and realistic ones (whiteboard explainer).

🚨 In one session, I generated 7 hook variations in 20 minutes.

My recommendation is to either lean into the weird, obscure and crazy. Visual metaphors are a great way to do this, e.g “Anyone else struggling with brainfog?” - show someone sat in a room with smoke filling rapidly.

Want it?

A hyper-realistic, cinematic video captures a vibrant, miniature landscape growing out of the pages of an open book. The camera, in an extreme close-up, glides over the book's yellowed paper, where printed railway tracks rise from the page and become 3D. Tiny, hyper-realistic grass and flowers sprout from the paper, creating a magical, unfolding world. The profound silence of a quiet room is broken by a faint, distant steam whistle and the magical rustling of the sprouting foliage.

Then, a perfect, miniature steam train rounds a bend formed by the book's gutter, puffing a thick plume of smoke into the air as it moves along the newly formed tracks. The train passes by lush, miniature trees and flower bushes that have grown from the pages. The miniature scene begins to generate its own light, casting realistic, moving shadows. The full, rich sound of the steam train becomes the dominant sound, accompanied by a gentle, enchanting orchestral score that swells as the story comes to life.",0,0,0,,en,YES

From beneath the waves, the camera glides alongside a WWII submarine cruising silently — beams of sunlight filter through the water as the periscope rises — above the surface, a convoy looms into view

Video 2 prompt:
The camera follows a torpedo launched from a submarine tube — racing through the dark sea, it cuts past fish and wreckage — in the distance, the hull of a warship grows larger until the explosion engulfs the frame

I combined them into one video, then imported it into Runway, where I created extra variations from different angles.

Concept: A hyper-realistic, 8-second video capturing a fierce Arabian warrior charging into battle on a powerful camel through a swirling sandstorm.

Scene Description: The video begins with a low-angle tracking shot, focusing on the powerful legs of a camel as it charges through deep, orange sand. A thick sandstorm whips around, obscuring the background and violently flapping the warrior's white robes. The sound is dominated by the rhythmic thumping of the camel's feet and the abrasive roar of the wind.

After 4 seconds, the camera smoothly cranes up to a dramatic close-up of the warrior's face. His eyes are narrowed with intense focus, and sand clings to his beard and eyelashes. He clutches two gleaming scimitars and lets out a fierce, guttural battle cry that cuts through the storm.

"I just recreated a Jones Road Beauty ad using Google Veo 3.

No actors. No cameras. Just Veo 3.

The entire process took 1 hour and cost $3.60 in Veo 3 credits.

Here's exactly how I did it →

First, I fed the original ad to Google Gemini.

It watched the video for me and broke down every single scene

Script. Shots. Transitions. Voiceovers. Everything.

Then came the magic:

→ Fed each scene description into Veo3
→ Included screenshots of original ad for reference images
→ Generated videos in one shot (no retakes)
→ Swapped the audio with ElevenLabs
→ Stitched it together in Capcut

Is it perfect? Definitely not.

(I used the cheaper model + only did one generation per clip)

Will it replace everything tomorrow? No.

But in 6 months, this will be how every DTC brand creates test creative.

A hyper-realistic, super-slow-motion macro video captures a tiny, white dragon hatching from an ornate egg held in gentle hands. The scene opens on the egg, which is covered in fine cracks, with a larger fissure visibly widening. The camera is in an extreme close-up, focusing on the suspenseful moment as small pieces of the shell flake off. The audio is a series of soft cracks and a faint, muffled chirping from inside the egg.

In the second half, the top of the egg shatters as the tiny dragon's wet head emerges. The camera slowly pushes in, focusing on the dragon's intelligent, bronze eye as it opens for the first time. The creature takes its first breath, releasing a puff of vapor with shimmering, magical motes. The lighting shifts to catch the glistening scales and the luminous eye. The quiet anticipation is replaced by a sense of wonder, with the sound of a soft ""pop,"" a high-pitched chirp, and a gentle, magical chime swelling in the background.",0,0,0,,en,YES
"We’ve just replaced our entire hook testing process with VEO 3 and the CTR lift is insane.

Here’s the exact play we’re running right now with ChatGPT + JSON prompts in Veo 3 to pump out high-performing hook variations in minutes:

1️⃣ Start with a proven ad
Either:
→ A best-performer you want to keep scaling
→ Or a creative with potential but low thumbstop (<30%)

2️⃣ Pull the core angle + script
Extract the main idea, script, and visual flow. This is your “seed”.
Example: first-person POV spooning creatine → we turned it into 10x more chaotic visual ideas.

3️⃣ Prompt ChatGPT for Veo-style hooks
Prompt: “You’re a creative strategist at a top D2C agency. Based on this product, angle, and persona, give me 3–5 Veo 3-style hooks for Meta ads.”

Feed it:
→ Brand
→ Product + benefit
→ Core angle
→ Persona
→ Script/framework link

Output should be movement-heavy, cinematic, pattern-interrupt style setups.

4️⃣ Approve, then convert to JSON
Pick the best hook and say: “Turn this into a Veo 3 JSON script format, but wait for my approval before generating.”

JSON forces precision:
→ Camera type/movement
→ Character details
→ Lighting/style
→ Dialogue tone
→ Constraints (no logos/text/music)

5️⃣ Drop into Veo 3 and generate
→ Text to Video in Google Gemini > Flow
→ V3 Fast, 10p per shot, skip Quality mode (slower, no big gains)

6️⃣ Repeat fast
Test extremes:
→ Absurd (spoon on a rollercoaster)
→ Relatable (whiteboard explainer)
→ Visual metaphors (“brain fog” → room filling with smoke)

We pulled 7 hooks in 20 minutes last week using this loop.

Concept → generate → launch.

"This Google Veo 3 ""frames to video"" feature is pure genius 💡

If you're creating video ads, this Veo 3 technique gives you surgical control over every scene element.

This frames-to-video feature will take any static product shot...

And turn it into cinematic reels with precise camera movements & timing.

Perfect for creative strategists, agencies, and DTC operators running video campaigns.

But instead of hoping AI generates what you hope for...

Just upload your reference image and get exact scene control in minutes.

The game-changer?

Your static assets become dynamic video gold → organized by camera moves, action sequences, & precise timing control.

Here's what frames-to-video gives you:

→ upload any product reference image 

→ add numbered annotations for camera movements

→ structure scene directions (I use JSON for precision)

→ set duration, fps, lighting specs

→ get frame-perfect video execution

→ no video shooting or expensive production needed

Now you've got director-level control from single images.

These HexClad reels were generated from two static product shots + a JSON prompt for each.

When your campaign needs cinematic quality but you only have product photos?

This frames-to-video workflow changes everything.

And it's only getting better

"VEO 3 + JSON prompting is pretty wild 🤯

These AG1 product videos were created entirely with AI.

And it's all about the prompt.

This JSON prompting technique will take any generic VEO3 prompt..

And turn it into surgical-precision video generation with brand consistency.

Perfect for creative strategists, growth marketers & ad agencies.

But instead of manually writing paragraph prompts and hoping for good outputs...

Just use structured JSON prompts and get brand-ready videos with way higher coherence.

The best part?

Your prompt precision goes through the roof -> organized by camera angles, brand elements, lighting specs, & scene transitions.

Here's what JSON prompting gives you:

→ structured data instead of paragraph descriptions

→ precise creative direction for VEO 3

→ consistent brand-ready video outputs

→ way higher prompt coherence

→ eliminates the creative lottery problem

Now you've got predictable video generation instead of random outputs.

This isn't perfect yet — but in 6 months when brand videos need this precision?

You'll be ahead of everyone.

"🕹️ Video Model Comparison: I2V Multi-Shot

→ Wan 2.2 
→ Veo 3
→ Seedance 1.0
→ Kling 2.1
→ Midjourney V1
→ Hailuo 02

I did a quick comparison with the same input image and multi-shot prompt on each model 2-4x.

Wan 2.2 was the shortest (I chose 3-sec on @replicate), but it produced several different perspectives in those few seconds!

"🎨 VEO 3 1080 P🎨

Prompt  :

Low-angle tracking perspective, fast-paced dynamic follow shot, a vintage sports car in gleaming crimson races through tight city streets, weaving between traffic and skimming past sharp corners with precision, tires screeching on the asphalt. The car's polished body reflects bursts of city light and neon signs as it accelerates under overpasses and through narrow alleys. Audio features the aggressive roar of the high-revving engine, gear shifts snapping cleanly, tires screeching, and the rush of wind as it blazes past. Hard, contrasty lighting with sharp highlights and cinematic motion blur. Cinematic style: high-energy chase sequence with retro flair, reminiscent of Ronin or The Italian Job.
