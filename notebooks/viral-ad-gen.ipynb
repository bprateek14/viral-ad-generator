The boat is surrounded by towering, jungle-covered limestone cliffs that form a hidden lagoon. The slow, gentle drone shot pushes forward and rises slightly, creating a sense of peaceful exploration. The scene is lit by soft, diffused daylight, which makes the water's color pop and fills the air with a soft, volumetric mist. The audio is a tranquil blend of the gentle lapping of water, the distant, echoing calls of exotic birds, and the soft creak of the boat's wood, evoking a sense of untouched beauty and mystery.\n",

      "A hyper-realistic, cinematic video captures a magical jungle ecosystem emerging from a laptop screen into a quiet, sunlit room. The video begins with a close-up shot on a laptop displaying a beautiful jungle image. A single, three-dimensional leaf begins to push through the screen's surface, the pixels distorting and shimmering around it. The ambient sound of the room is joined by a faint, magical, shimmering sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "The camera slowly pulls back to reveal a full, blossoming tree growing rapidly out of the screen, its branches reaching into the room. Five tiny, energetic monkeys climb out, chattering and exploring their new surroundings. The light from the laptop screen now acts as a magical backlight, casting a vibrant green glow into the room. The quiet is replaced by the lively sounds of the jungle—the chattering of monkeys, the rustle of leaves, and an enchanting birdsong—as the digital and natural worlds seamlessly blend.\n",

      "64. [en] 🔥We created 7 ad hooks in 20 minutes using Google’s Veo 3\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s the exact step-by-step process we’re using right now to generate high-performing hook variations using ChatGPT + JSON Prompts + Veo 3:\n",
      "\n",
      "1️⃣ Start with a top-performing ad\n",
      "\n",
      "Either:\n",
      "→ a best-performing creative you want to keep scaling\n",
      "→ or one that’s showing promise but has low thumbstop (under 30%)\n",
      "\n",
      "2️⃣ Find the core angle and script.\n",
      "Pull the core idea, script, and visual structure from the winning creative. This becomes your seed for prompting. In this case, it was a first-person shooter-style creative with a spoon of creatine.\n",
      "\n",
      "💡 We took this visual insight, and 10X’d it in craziness\n",
      "\n",
      "3️⃣ Use ChatGPT to brainstorm new hooks.\n",
      "Prompt GPT like this: “You’re a creative strategist at a leading D2C agency. Based on this concept, product, angle, and persona, give me 3–5 Veo 3-style hooks for Meta ads.”\n",
      "\n",
      "You’ll want to input:\n",
      "→ Brand\n",
      "→ Product + benefit\n",
      "→ Core angle\n",
      "→ Character/persona\n",
      "→ A script or framework link\n",
      "\n",
      "The ideas that come back should be bold, movement-heavy visuals. Think strong setups, pattern-interrupts, cinematic energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "4️⃣ Pick your favourite idea and convert it into JSON\n",
      "\n",
      "Once ChatGPT gives you options, choose one and prompt it again: “Turn this into a Veo 3 JSON script format, but don’t generate until I approve.”\n",
      "\n",
      "JSON works better than freeform text in Veo 3. That JSON format includes everything:\n",
      "\n",
      "→ Camera type\n",
      "→ Shot movement\n",
      "→ Character detail\n",
      "→ Lighting and style\n",
      "→ Dialogue tone\n",
      "→ Constraints (no logos, no text, no music)\n",
      "\n",
      "5️⃣ Paste into Veo 3 and generate\n",
      "- Use Text to Video under Google Gemini > Flow\n",
      "- Always choose V3 Fast, 10p per shot, faster, more output\n",
      "- Quality mode is slower and haven’t seen any major benefits when A/B testing\n",
      "\n",
      "6️⃣ Repeat\n",
      "Use learnings from your account to test both absurd hooks (spoon on a rollercoaster) and realistic ones (whiteboard explainer).\n",
      "\n",
      "🚨 In one session, I generated 7 hook variations in 20 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "My recommendation is to either lean into the weird, obscure and crazy. Visual metaphors are a great way to do this, e.g “Anyone else struggling with brainfog?” - show someone sat in a room with smoke filling rapidly.\n",

      "A hyper-realistic, high-resolution, super-slow-motion cinematic video sequence of a lioness stalking her prey at sunset. The camera is a low-angle tracking shot that follows the lioness as she moves through a vast, arid savanna. The golden-hour lighting creates a warm, golden orange light that backlights the lioness and casts long, dramatic shadows. The camera has a shallow depth of field, keeping the lioness in perfect focus while the background of dry, yellow grass and a few sparse acacia trees is a soft, out-of-focus blur. The sound is designed to be a complete, hyper-realistic experience of a wild hunt, with only the soft 'thud' of her paws and the gentle 'rustle' of the grass breaking the absolute silence.\n",

      "Scene Description: The video begins with a low-angle tracking shot, focusing on the powerful legs of a camel as it charges through deep, orange sand. A thick sandstorm whips around, obscuring the background and violently flapping the warrior's white robes. The sound is dominated by the rhythmic thumping of the camel's feet and the abrasive roar of the wind.\n",

      "After 4 seconds, the camera smoothly cranes up to a dramatic close-up of the warrior's face. His eyes are narrowed with intense focus, and sand clings to his beard and eyelashes. He clutches two gleaming scimitars and lets out a fierce, guttural battle cry that cuts through the storm. A heroic orchestral score swells as the video ends on his determined, unyielding expression.\n",

    "- Use the **7-Component Structure** precisely for this scene:\n",
    "  1. **Subject** – Rich description (15+ attributes: age, gender, ethnicity, hair, eyes, build, clothing, posture, mannerisms, distinctive features, emotional state, voice style, etc.).\n",
    "  2. **Action** – What the subject(s) are doing: gestures, movements, pacing, emotional changes.\n",
    "  3. **Scene** – Environment details: location, props, lighting, time of day, atmosphere, textures.\n",
    "  4. **Style** – Cinematic elements: camera placement _(use Veo-3 explicit camera syntax like: (close-up shot), (tracking shot), (aerial view))_, lighting style, color palette, visual tone.\n",
    "  5. **Dialogue (optional)** – Use colon syntax, include tone indicators. (Character: \"…\").\n",
    "  6. **Sounds** – Ambient audio, music, sound effects, voices, silence.\n",
    "  7. **Technical (Negative Prompt)** – Explicitly list what to avoid: watermarks, text overlays, poor quality, distortions, artifacts, broken limbs, off-screen cuts, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure:\n",
    "  - Scene duration fits **≈8 seconds** but feels cinematic.  \n",
    "  - Tone is **viral-ad style**: catchy, emotionally engaging, with a share-worthy quality.  \n",
    "  - End with a **scene-level micro-hook** (mini call-to-action or emotional beat) that leads naturally into the next scene.  \n",

The camera, in ultra-high 8K, pans left to right, revealing a lone traveler silhouetted against the rising sun. The lighting is ethereal—warm, cinematic, and immersive—casting dramatic shadows that evoke a sense of awe and possibility. The setting is vast and atmospheric, inspired by Denis Villeneuve’s epic style, instantly transporting viewers to an otherworldly, aspirational landscape. Subtle, orchestral music swells as the traveler’s boots crunch softly on the sand. No product is shown yet, but a faint glint of metallic blue peeks from the traveler’s backpack, hinting at something extraordinary. The emotional beat is one of curiosity and anticipation, designed to interrupt scrolling and make viewers wonder: Who is this traveler? Where are they going?

The camera gently shakes, simulating the physical toll and immersing viewers in the struggle. The setting underscores a universal pain point—feeling overwhelmed, isolated, and in need of something more. The traveler glances at their backpack, frustration and longing in their eyes. A quick flash of the Veo 3 Fast logo on a sleek, futuristic water bottle peeks from a side pocket, organically integrated but not forced. The audio shifts to a subtle, pulsing heartbeat, amplifying tension. The emotional beat is empathy: viewers relate to the struggle and crave a breakthrough.
